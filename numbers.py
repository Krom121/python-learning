""" Creating a mathematical expression comprised of various operators will be subject to the operator precedence set of rules. These rules are used heavily in algebra. When working with a compound expression that is made up of multiple simpler expressions chained together, we need a way to determine which operations receive precedence. This operator precedence is determined using the BEMDAS order, which stands for Brackets, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. It is also sometimes referred to as BOMDAS, where the O stands for Orders. """
